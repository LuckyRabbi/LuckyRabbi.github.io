We're tryna jump into the mix, wondering bout problems to be fixed.

A boy walked into the rain, feeling overwhelmed by the bedlam of the places he's been that day. The rain reminded him that eventually everything will be washed away. Any sense of permanence is a falsehood, the concrete that steadied the steps of countless wandering minds will one day be gone and the minds themselves forgotten too.

It was a ritual of cleansing, an act of necessity, as though his mind had been filled with rubble; he knew that as the rain danced across his face a flood would gently lift the remnants of the day and carry them away.

He knew that the rain would eventually stop, the water would settle and seep to be taken away again; he was calm, content and clean. His life would matter, his mind would scatter and fray and when it did, he'd do a little rain dance and the rain would come again and wash it all away.
